# FCM Digital - QA Technical challenge
Welcome to the FCM Digital QA team technical challenge, the objective of this challenge is to learn more about the way you work. There is no single solution, so don't worry, just do the best you can. 

## Challenge information
You will have to create a fork of this repository on which you will work. Once you complete the challenge, you will contact us via email and we will proceed to review it.

## Goals
Given some epics witch their user stories and acceptance criterias:
 1. Write the test cases in the README.md file, Test Cases section.
 2. Create a project using YARN.
 3. Install Cypress using YARN.
